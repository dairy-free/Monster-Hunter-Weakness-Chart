This project was created using raw/vanilla HTML, SCSS, and JS.

this site is intended to be used in tandem with the game “Monster Hunter World”.

There are several elements a monster can be weak to. The elements are Water, Thunder, Ice, Dragon, Poison, Sleep, Paralysis, Blast, and Stun.

Data is gathered from mhw-db API using Async Await. Depending on the monster chosen it will load which element it is weak against that is measured with “stars” with three being the highest and one being the weakest.

As an example, if Anjanath is chosen he is weakest against the water element because of his three-star rating against water.
